# fastMethod

This repository contains the models, Jupyter notebooks and computed gMCSs referenced in the paper 'A fast method for extracting essential and synthetic
lethality genes in GEM models'

We have also included the  models used in the folder 'models' and the computed gMCSs for each model in the gMCSs folder. These gMCSs are packed using pickle.

All the necessary notebooks required to execute this algorithm on the three different models provided are included in the 'JupyterNotebooks' folder.

The following Python libraries are needed in order to execute the notebooks:
- cobra
- time
- more_itertools
- multiprocessing
- random

A running cplex library under Python must be installed in order to run the notebooks.
