# fastMethod

The necessary notebooks required to execute this algorithm on the three different models provided are included in the 'JupyterNotebooks' folder.

The following Python libraries are needed in order to execute the notebooks:
- cobra
- time
- more_itertools
- multiprocessing
- random

You will also need to have a running cplex library under Python.

We have also included the necessary models in the folder 'models' and the computed gMCSs in the gMCSs folder. These gMCSs are packed using pickle.
